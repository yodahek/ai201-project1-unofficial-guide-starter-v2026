"""
Stage 2 of the pipeline: splitting documents into chunks.

⚠️ THIS IS THE FILE YOU CHANGE IN MILESTONE 3.

`split_documents` below is deliberately plain. It cuts every document into
fixed-size pieces with a fixed overlap and pays no attention to where sentences
or paragraphs end. It works, and it is not good.

On a corpus of short posts it may not cut anything at all: `campus_life` comes
out as 88 documents and 88 chunks, because almost nothing in it reaches 800
characters. That is the baseline, not a bug — Milestone 3 is where you decide
whether one post should stay one chunk.

Your job in Milestone 3 is to replace the *body* of `split_documents` with a
strategy that fits the documents you actually read in Milestone 1. Keep the
name and the shape of what it returns — the rest of the pipeline calls it, and
your README has to name the function that produced your chunks.

If you get stuck for 30 minutes, `fallback_split` is the original. Switch back
to it, write down what you saw, and move on. That's a real observation about
your pipeline, not giving up.
